Introduction:
-------------------------
During the summer of 2014 the New England states initiated a monitoring program for cyanobacteria in lakes.  Participants included state and tribal governments, local watershed associations, EPA Region 1, and the EPA Atlantic Ecology Division. 

The task now is to collate all the data into a standardized format.  Below are the data processing steps used and some questions to be resolved for each data contributor.

A simple excel template for data entry is available here: https://github.com/willbmisled/Reg1Cyano/blob/master/Data2014/Region1CyanobacteriaDataEntryTemplate.xls?raw=true

New Hampshire
-------------------------
* Data received from Sonya Carlson on 11/19/14
* Original file name: NH-2014-11-19-PhycoData.xlsx renamed Cyano2014_NH.xlsx
* Locations in table "List_Frame_1".  Observations are numbered consecutively in the first column ("#"). There are 143 lines. SiteIDs in column "DES Station ID"; some are missing but can be found in the "Station Name" Column 
* Observation in table "Data". Observations are numbered consecutively in the first column ("Sample #"). Note: Sample#=42 is used twice).  There are 144 lines.  
* Tables "Data" and "List_Frame_1" are copied and renamed: "DataEdited" and "Locations".  The first column in each table ("Sample #" and "#") is renamed "Order".  The "DES Sation ID" field is renamed "SiteID".  In the DataEdited table the first occurence of Order=42 changed to 42.1 and the second occurence to 42.2.
* Table DataEdited: The names of the value fields for the Fluorometry readings are on three lines.  These were combined into a single field name using the following convention- Pigment_Units_Fluorometer_SampleState_FilterState.  These will be split up and renamed later.
* Compare the fields Order and SiteID for tables Location and DataEdited
    - Order 2 & 3 are reversed-The Order field in the Locations table was changed to correct this. Flag and comment added.
    - Order 83 & 84 are reversed-The Order field in the Locations table was changed to correct this. Flag and comment added.
    - Order 42 is repeated in the DataEdited table.  First occurence changed to 42.1 and second occurence changed to 42.1.Flags and comments added.
    - DataEdited:Order=42.2 matches Locations:Order=42; Locations:Order changed to 42.2.  
    - DataEdited:Order=42.1 missing in Locations but a lake with the same SiteID is listed in DataEdited:Order=54.  The location information is recopied into the Locations table as Locations:Order=42.1
    - For Order=135 in both tables the SiteID don't match DataEdited:SiteID="TOWCAN-GEN
" and Locations:SiteID="TOWCND-GEN".  Simple mispelling. Flag and comment added.
    - For Order = c(22:23,27:30,35:36,55:56,67:68,72,85-93,98:99,117:118,123,125:126) Location:SiteID is missing but the DataEdited:SiteID = Locations:StationName.  Comment only added.
    - Table Locations is reordered by the updated Order field.
    - Fields "EpaDesignation", "SampleDate", and "Depth" match between tables DataUpdated and Locations.
    -Field="WaterbodyName" added and populated with LakeName for the StationName and Waterbody# fields.
* Table NHDES_Raw created by copying the Region1CyanobacteriaTemplate file.
* Location data transfered to the NHDES with fields as follows (NHDES:Locations)
    - Order=Order 
    - WaterbodyName=WaterbodyName
    - SiteLocation=StationName
    - Latitude=Latitude
    - Longitude=Longitude
    - Flags and Comments copied.
* DataEdited fields transfered as following
    - SiteID=SiteID (originally-"DES Station ID")
    - SampleDate=SampleDate
    - WeatherCondition=WeatherConditions
    - SampleLocation=EPA Designation (note naming convention changed to match template).  Note SampleLocations listed as "GRAB" changed to "Other" and "SampleMethod" noted as "Grab"
    - Depth=Depth
* The following compound fields were also added to NHDES_RAW (NOTE these will need to be parsed): 
    - Phycocyanin_mg/l_Beagle_Fresh_Unfiltered  
    - Chlorophyll_mg/l_Beagle_Fresh_Unfiltered	
    - Phycocyanin_RFU_Turner_Fresh_Unfiltered	
    - Chlorophyll_RFU_Turner_Fresh_Unfiltered	
    - Phycocyanin_mg/l_Beagle_Fresh_Filtered	
    - Chlorophyll_mg/l_Beagle_Fresh_Filtered	
    - Phycocyanin_RFU_Turner_Fresh_Filtered	
    - Chlorophyll_RFU_Turner_Fresh_Filtered	
    - Phycocyanin_mg/l_Beagle_Frozen_Unfiltered	
    - Chlorophyll_mg/l_Beagle_Frozen_Unfiltered	
    - Phycocyanin_RFU_Turner_Frozen_Unfiltered	
    - Chlorophyll_RFU_Turner_Frozen_Unfiltered	
    - Phycocyanin_mg/l_Beagle_Frozen_Filtered	
    - Chlorophyll_mg/l_Beagle_Frozen_Filtered	
    - Phycocyanin_RFU_Turner_Frozen_Filtered	
    - Chlorophyll_RFU_Turner_Frozen_Filtered
* NOTE: the Beagle units are ug/l not mg/l.  This is corrected below in the final version.
* Table NHDES_RAW from Cyano2014_NH.xlsx saved as NHDES_RAW.csv
    - Date parsed to Year Month Day
* NHDES_RAW.csv read into R (code in the .rmd document) and the compound value fields parsed.  
* Final version saved as NHDES.csv


Questions for Sonya: all have been answered and the data updated.

* The locations are in tab "List_Frame_1" and the Data are in the data tab.  Both sets of data appear to be linked by the first column ("#" or "Sample #").  It appears that a some of the lines are out of order (i.e., 2 & 3 and 83 & 84).  This is not a problem I just adjusted them.  Is this okay?
    - Okay
* In the data tab there are 2 entries for Sample#=42.  The first for DESStationID=BEELTUFD is not in the List_Frame_1 tab but the second (DESStationID=BROOSSD) is.  To correct this I used the location information from Sample#=54 (DESStationID=BEELTUFD).  Is this okay?
    - Okay
* For Sample#=135 the DES Station ID is "TOWCAN-GEN
" in the Data tab and "TOWCND-GEN" in the List_Frame_1 tab.  Which is correct?
    - TOWCND-GEN: this is corrected above
* Could you verify the units for the Beagle readings.  You have mg/l but others report ug/l.
    - Should be ug/l-corrected above.


Connecticut
-------------------------
* Data received from Tracy Lizotte on 11/17/14
* Original file name: "Cyanobacteria data Summer 2014.xlsx"
* Data organized with a seperate lake in each tab.  
* Each lake has a parameter field and includes many parameters besides the fluorometry data but most of these are missing values.
* All of the beagle fluorometry data where copied into a single tab by filtering on the notes field and selecting records for "Beagle Flourometer".
* Missing values changed to blanks
* Data copied into the template and saved as CTDEEP.csv


Questions for Tracy:

* For the Housatonic River (Kettletown) on 7/7/2014 the fluorometer values are "337.23//254.39", "310.87//363.l59", "24.91//7.50", and "2.50//5.50".  Do these represent multiple observations from the same sample or perhaps readings from 2 different samples? For now I am calling these reps and have separated the values.
* What are the measurement units? RFU, ug/l?
* Where were the samples taken?  Shoreside? or Within Lake?
* What depth were the samples taken at?
* How were the samples taken?  Grab samples? Whole Water Samples? Integrated Tube Samples?
* I have some but not all of the Latitude and Longitudes for the lakes.  Please check the file CTDEEP_Locations.csv and verify the locations (I can send a map of the locations if you wish) and fill in missing values. 



Vermont
-------------------------
* Data received from Hilary Snook (forwarded from Angela Shambaugh-VTDEC) on 11/13/14
* Original file name: VERMONT Beagle FluoroQuick data_Summer 2014.xlsx
* Two tabs
    - "calibrated pigment readings" includes sample dates 6/23/2014-8/20/2014
    - "after calibration loss" includes sample dates 8/19/2014-9/19/2014
* Tabs combined into a single sheet and comment added to show which tab was the source.
* Data saved as VTDEC.csv



Questions for Angela:

* Do we need to treat the two groups of data ("calibrated pigment readings" & "after calibration loss") separately?
* What are the differences between the two groups of data?
* What is the difference between "blank" and "blank(2)" in the "station" field?
* For parameter what do: "channel 1 hi", "channel 1 lo", and channel 2 lo" represent?
* Where were the samples taken?  Shoreside? or Within Lake?  I'm assuming that the 1m depth samples are Shoreside and the 3m or greater depth samples are within lake but would like to verify.
* What are the units for fluorometer readings?
* For the "sample state" VTDEC reports the conditions shown in the table below.  What information is important?  For each condition we need to know whether the sample was frozen (TRUE/FALSE) or filtered (TRUE/FALSE) before the fluoremeter reading was taken. You can also use flags to indicate readings that need to be checked with the details in the comments field.
* Please check the file VTDEC_Locations.csv.  I have some of the locations but not all.  The locations I have were gleaned from the lake Champlain reports.  In some cases I used Google Earth to get the locations from the descriptions so I don't have a lot of confidence in the locations.  Can you verify the locations (I can send a map of the locations if you wish) and help me with the ones that are missing?
